Cybersecurity Lab Example: SQL Injection

Lab Objective: Demonstrate how SQL injection vulnerabilities can be exploited and how to mitigate them.

Steps:
1. Identify input fields vulnerable to SQL injection.
2. Attempt to inject SQL commands (e.g., ' OR 1=1 --).
3. Observe unauthorized data access.
4. Apply parameterized queries to fix the vulnerability.

Key Takeaway: Always validate and sanitize user input and use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
